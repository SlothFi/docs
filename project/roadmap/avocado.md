# ðŸ¥‘ Avocado

Our team has quite a lot of experience in building large scale social media networks. While we dwelled into the NFT space, we found the lack of viewership for the smaller artist.

Most NFT Marketplaces tend to promote artists that already have a huge following or artists that are willing to pay to be seen more, we wanted to remove this restriction and thus Avocado was born.

The basic idea behind Avocado is to allow NFT buyers find NFTs similar to what the already like/own. The users will be presented a feed where they will be able to see new NFTs posted by the artists they follow. With our experience in building social networks, we've gathered a lot of feedback about what users actually prefer and what not.

Key features of Avocado are listed as follows:

1. Users can like/comment/share NFTs.
2. Users can follow/unfollow other users (or artists).
3. Users can buy/sell/auction NFTs.

We believe in giving freedom and usability back to the user.&#x20;

Avocado will be present in form of a mobile-friendly DApp, as well as a native mobile app.&#x20;
