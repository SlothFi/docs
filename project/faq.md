### Does SlothFi have a Token?

We plan to launch our token in February 2022, giving us enough time to work on our projects. Currently the planning for tokenomics of the token is in works, we're discussing with known developers in the Harmony ecosystem regarding this.

We're open to ideas about our token's listing, trading and allocation.
